    <h1>Introduction To DBMS</h1>

    <section id="first">
        <h2>What is DBMS ?</h2>
        <p> <strong>Database Management System (DBMS)</strong>  is a software used to manage data from a database.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A database is a structured collection of data that is stored in an electronic device. The data can be text, video, image or any other format.</li>
            <li>A relational database stores data in the form of tables and a NoSQL database in the form of key-value pairs.</li>
            <li>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating data in a relational database.</li>
            <li>A DBMS is a software that allows to create, update and retrieval of data in an organized way. It also provides security to the database.</li>
            <li>Examples of relational DBMS are MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Postgre SQL and Snowflake</li>
            <li>Examples of NoSQL DBMS are MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB and Redis.</li>
        </ul> <br>

        <h2>Advantages of DBMS</h2>
        <p>There are some following reasons to learn DBMS : </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Organizing and management of data:</b> DBMS helps in managing large amounts of data in an organized manner. It provides features like create, edit, delete, and read.</li>
            <li><b>Data Security:</b> DBMS provides Security to the data from the unauthorized person.</li>
            <li><b>Improved decision-making:</b> From stored data in the database we can generate graphs, reports, and many visualizations which helps in decision-making.</li>
            <li><b>Consistency:</b> In a traditional database model all things are manual or inconsistent, but DBMS enables to automation of the operations by queries.</li>
            
        </ul> <br>

        <h2>Disadvantages of DBMS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Complexity:</b> DBMS can be hard to design, implement, and manage, needing specialized knowledge.</li>
            <li><b>Cost</b>: High setup costs, including hardware, software, and skilled personnel, can be expensive. Ongoing maintenance adds to the cost.</li>
            <li><b>Performance Overhead:</b> DBMS might slow down simple tasks due to their extra features and general-purpose nature.</li>
            <li><b>Security Risks:</b> Centralizing data can create security risks. If the system is hacked, all data could be compromised.</li>
            <li><b>Resource Intensive:</b> DBMS need a lot of memory, storage, and processing power, which can be costly.</li>
            <li><b>Data Integrity Issues:</b> Complex systems can lead to data integrity problems if not managed well.</li>
        </ul> <br>
