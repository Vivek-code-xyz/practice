/* ---------------- CSS Animation Properties Explained ---------------- */

/* 1. animation-name: 
   - Specifies the name of the @keyframes to be used for the animation.
   - Without it, no animation will run.
*/
animation-name: myAnimation;

/* 2. animation-duration:
   - Defines how long the animation takes to complete one cycle.
   - Value: time in seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms).
*/
animation-duration: 2s;

/* 3. animation-timing-function:
   - Controls the speed curve (how animation accelerates/decelerates).
   - Common values:
       linear → same speed throughout
       ease → slow start, fast middle, slow end (default)
       ease-in → slow start → fast end
       ease-out → fast start → slow end
       ease-in-out → slow start & end, fast middle
       steps(n) → divides animation into n steps (like frame by frame)
*/
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;

/* 4. animation-delay:
   - Adds waiting time before animation starts.
   - Value: time in s/ms.
*/
animation-delay: 1s;

/* 5. animation-iteration-count:
   - How many times animation should repeat.
   - Values:
       number → e.g., 3 means runs 3 times
       infinite → keeps running forever
*/
animation-iteration-count: infinite;

/* 6. animation-direction:
   - Controls direction of each animation cycle.
   - Values:
       normal → default, plays forward
       reverse → plays backward
       alternate → forward then backward
       alternate-reverse → backward then forward
*/
animation-direction: alternate;

/* 7. animation-fill-mode:
   - Decides the style before & after animation.
   - Values:
       none → default, no effect after animation ends
       forwards → keeps final state after animation ends
       backwards → applies starting state before it begins
       both → applies both before & after effects
*/
animation-fill-mode: forwards;

/* 8. animation-play-state:
   - Controls animation running or paused.
   - Values:
       running → default, animation plays normally
       paused → stops the animation when triggered
*/
animation-play-state: running;

/* ---------------- Shorthand property ----------------
   Instead of writing all above individually, we can use one line:
   Example:
animation: name duration timing delay iteration direction fill-mode;
*/
animation: myAnimation 2s ease-in-out 1s infinite alternate forwards;

/* ---------------- Keyframes Example ----------------
   - Defines what changes during the animation cycle
*/
@keyframes myAnimation {
  0% { transform: translateX(0); }
  50% { transform: translateX(100px); }
  100% { transform: translateX(0); }
}

/* ---------------- Real Example ---------------- */
.myBox {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  animation: myAnimation 3s ease-in-out 0s infinite alternate forwards;
}
