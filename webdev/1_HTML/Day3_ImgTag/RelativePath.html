<!-- adding ./ in img src tag before file name of image will jump to parent folder which contains that file
same if you add ../ in front it will access parent's parent folder

like if i want to access image which is present on Day2 folder from Day 3 using img tag so 
first i jump to webdev folder by adding ../  then adding name of child folder to access(Day2) then
1 extra / then image file name and done -->

 <img src="./Mindimg.jpeg" height="100" widht="100"> <!-- can access image of own folder -->

 <img src="../Day2/LandScape.jpg" height="100" width="100"> <!-- can access image of parent's folder -->

<!-- 
 ./  -> access to all same level files on own folder
 ../  -> one level up
 ../../ -> two level up
 ../../../ ->  tree level up


 /filename  ->one level down
 /filename/filename  ->two level down -->
